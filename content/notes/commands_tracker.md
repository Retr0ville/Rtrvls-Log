## ntfsfix

```bash
sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda1
```

I have somehow managed to crash the file-system of my HDD and now it refuses to mount on ```/dev/sda1``` , this nifty command comes to the rescue.

exact error text üëâüèΩ

> Error mounting /dev/sda1/ at /run/media : wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.



## mount

All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file-system found on some external device, like a hard drive to the big file tree so its content can be accessible.

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -t auto
```

The above command will mount the device `sda1` on your `/mnt` folde- ..I mean directory.



## umount

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda1
```

Will unmount the file-system at `/dev/sda1/`



## rsync

rsync is a file transfer program capable of efficient local or remote trasnfer operations via a fast differencing algorithm.

```bash
rsync -av /mnt/Downloads /home/rtrvl/Downloads/
```

This would copy all files from `/mnt/Downloads` into `/home/rtrvl/Downloads/` 



## df

```bash
df -h
```

Will list all mounted file systems.

## du

`du` is the disk usage command

```bash
du -sh /path/to/folder
```

- `-s`: Summarizes the disk usage of the specified directory, rather than listing sizes of individual subdirectories and files within it.

  

- `-h`: Displays sizes in human-readable format.
